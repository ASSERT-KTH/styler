   *     RFC-4880 ยง5.14: Modification Detection Code Packet</a>
   *
   *     <blockquote>The Modification Detection Code packet contains a SHA-1 hash of
   *     plaintext data, which is used to detect message modification.  It is
   *     only used with a Symmetrically Encrypted Integrity Protected Data
   *     packet.  The Modification Detection Code packet MUST be the last
   *     packet in the plaintext data that is encrypted in the Symmetrically
   *     Encrypted Integrity Protected Data packet, and MUST appear in no
   *     other place.
   *
   *     A Modification Detection Code packet MUST have a length of 20 octets.
   *
   *     The body of this packet consists of:
   *
   *     - A 20-octet SHA-1 hash of the preceding plaintext data of the
   *     Symmetrically Encrypted Integrity Protected Data packet,
   *     including prefix data, the tag octet, and length octet of the
   *     Modification Detection Code packet.
   *
   *     Note that the Modification Detection Code packet MUST always use a
   *     new format encoding of the packet tag, and a one-octet encoding of
   *     the packet length.  The reason for this is that the hashing rules for
   *     modification detection include a one-octet tag and one-octet length
   *     in the data hash.  While this is a bit restrictive, it reduces
   *     complexity.
