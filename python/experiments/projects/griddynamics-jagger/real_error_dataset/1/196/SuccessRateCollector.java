/** Collects number of pass and fail invokes
 * @author Dmitry Latnikov
 * @n
 * @par Details:
 * @details Collects number of pass and fail invokes. @n
 * Success rate and number of fails are calculated from this data. @n
 * Calculation is provided by aggregators: @n
 * @li @ref SuccessRateAggregatorProvider @n
 * @li @ref SuccessRateFailsAggregatorProvider @n
 *
 * @par Usage example in XML:
 * To use this collector add @xlink{metric-success-rate} collector to @xlink{test-description,info-collectors} block.
 * @n
 * @dontinclude  tasks-new.conf.xml
 * @skip  begin: following section is used for docu generation - metric-success-rate
 * @until end: following section is used for docu generation - metric-success-rate
 * @n
 * @par Result example:
 * @image html jagger_success_rate_default_agg.png "Success rate data with default accumulative aggregators"
 * @n
 * @n
 * @image html jagger_success_rate_avg_agg.png "Success rate data with aggregator: average on interval"
