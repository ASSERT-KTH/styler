/**
 * An N state synchronization latch useful for implementing hydration/dehydration. The
 * latch functions as follows. At any time, the latch is in one of N states and has a
 * count. Clients can "latch" and "release" the latch, which increments/decrements the
 * count; however, when latching, a state must be specified. If the state does not match
 * the current state, the latch blocks until the count is zero. Essentially, the latch
 * can change state only when the count is zero. Every time the latch changes state an
 * optional {@link Runnable} corresponding to the new state is executed.
