/**
 * This annotation makes the class on which it is applied, injectable. In the basic case, the class will be
 * injectable with its own type:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@literal @}Bind
 *  public class SomeImplementation {...}
 *
 * {@literal @}Inject
 *  SomeImplementation someImplementation;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If an injection class is specified with {@link #from()}, the implementation will be injectable with the specified
 * type instead:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@literal @}Bind(from = SomeInterface.class)
 *  public class SomeImplementation implements SomeInterface {...}
 *
 * {@literal @}Inject
 *  SomeInterface someInterface;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>The {@link Bind} annotation allows to override any interface-based SeedStack binding.</strong> To do this,
 * create a custom implementation of the SeedStack interface you want to customize (this is the type you use at the
 * injection point) and set the {@link Bind#override()} boolean to true. Your custom implementation will replace the
 * SeedStack one.
 * </p>
 * <p></p>
 * <p>
 * When a qualifier annotation is present on the implementation class, it is used to make the injection point more
 * specific:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@literal @}Qualifier
 * {@literal @}Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
 *  public interface {@literal @}SomeQualifier {...}
 *
 * {@literal @}Bind(from = SomeInterface.class)
 * {@literal @}SomeQualifier
 *  public class SomeImplementation implements SomeInterface {...}
 *
 * {@literal @}Inject
 * {@literal @}SomeQualifier
 *  SomeInterface someInterface;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>When having multiple implementations of the same interface, using a different qualifier on each implementation
 * allows to create multiple bindings. You can then choose the implementation by specifying the corresponding qualifier
 * at injection point.</p>
