/**
 * A client to Container Analysis API.
 *
 * <p>The interfaces provided are listed below, along with usage samples.
 *
 * <p>============================== ContainerAnalysisV1Beta1Client ==============================
 *
 * <p>Service Description: Retrieves analysis results of Cloud components such as Docker container
 * images. The Container Analysis API is an implementation of the [Grafeas](grafeas.io) API.
 *
 * <p>Analysis results are stored as a series of occurrences. An `Occurrence` contains information
 * about a specific analysis instance on a resource. An occurrence refers to a `Note`. A note
 * contains details describing the analysis and is generally stored in a separate project, called a
 * `Provider`. Multiple occurrences can refer to the same note.
 *
 * <p>For example, an SSL vulnerability could affect multiple images. In this case, there would be
 * one note for the vulnerability and an occurrence for each image with the vulnerability referring
 * to that note.
 *
 * <p>Sample for ContainerAnalysisV1Beta1Client:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * try (ContainerAnalysisV1Beta1Client containerAnalysisV1Beta1Client = ContainerAnalysisV1Beta1Client.create()) {
 *   IamResourceName resource = NoteName.of("[PROJECT]", "[NOTE]");
 *   Policy policy = Policy.newBuilder().build();
 *   Policy response = containerAnalysisV1Beta1Client.setIamPolicy(resource, policy);
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
