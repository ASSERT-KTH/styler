/** Special resource bundle which delegates to two others.
 * Ideally could just set the parent on the first, but this is protected,
 * so it might not work.  It's still unclear whether that approach would work
 * in this subclass because it may break the localization fall through
 * mechanism if used.
 * Note: This code is copied from NbBundle in the openide sources with
 * the following modifications:
 * - reformatting
 * - making variables final
 * - renaming variables and some params
 * - removing locale code
 * - creating the merged set of keys using jdk classes and not nb utils
